# NoFraudToken
An AI-assisted Identifier, Database and Bulk Burner for fraudulent NFTs

## 0x00 Inspiration
Because of the limitations of the ethereum protocol with respect to the implementation of accounts (both EOA and contract account) and NFT Token Standards (ERC-721 and ERC-1155), we as ordinary wallet (address/account) owners can't really "reject" an airdrop from a NFT contract, we can only passively receive it, not knowing for what purpose it was minted and by whom. This also gives the ground for phishing attacks that use fraudulent NFT airdrops. 

My own hot wallet (ENS: [hannesgao.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd02722722615935330252bD616bF4D0590840563)) has been airdropped hundreds of different fraudulent NFTs on Polygon and Gnosis Chain, which I as a techie and OCD patient cannot tolerate. But if I need to transfer these fraudulent NFTs one by one to the burning address via traditional methods (e.g. front-end interaction on OpenSea using Metamask, signing, authorizing, sending), burning a single fraudulent NFT will take me at least 1-2 minutes, which is a huge waste of time. 

## 0x01 What it does
So a great (and simple) product idea came up: 
> Why can't we just build a simple front-end application that allows users to link their wallets, read all NFTs on a certain chain in the wallet, present them on the front-end by user-selected sequence, and to filter out all the NFTs they want to burn by keyword (maybe a combination of keywords, or just a simple regex), with simple interactions by checking a box with the mouse or clicking the "Select All" button, and a simple smart contract or two to bulk-sign, authorize, and bulk-transfer these fraudulent NFTs to the burn address in just one single on-chain transaction to save gas!

Doesn't it sound wonderful? 

If you are worried about users choosing the wrong valuable NFT and mixing it with fraudulent NFTs that need to be bulk burned, don't be afraid, we will apply the large language model [GPT-4](https://openai.com/gpt-4/) and the image recognition model [DALL·E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3) provided by [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction), as well as a filter based of audit information databases and APIs from the major NFT marketplaces (e.g. [OpenSea](https://docs.opensea.io/), [Element](https://api.element.market/openapi/), [BLUR](https://blur.io/) and [X2Y2](https://x2y2.readme.io/reference/introduction/)) to help our users to identify whether a NFT and its collection is a fraudulent or not, based on its contract address and metadata! In order to allow the user to make the right judgment in the possible shortest time, we will provide a simple scoring system with color differences on the front-end.

Additionally, based on the contract addresses of fraudulent NFTs burned by users, we will collect all the metadata of these fraudulent NFTs into our database for review, which can also be used to improve the accuracy of the prediction scores mentioned above and used to train our own AI models for more accuracy in determining whether an NFT is a fraud or not. 

Don't worry about any privacy issues, the user's wallet address will never be collected, we will only collect the contract address and metadata of the fraudulent NFTs that were burned, and use it for transparent AI model training and for formal purposes to improve Web3 security (e.g. providing our database to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) as an criteria for labeling certain NFT contracts).

## 0x02 How would we build it (Technology Stack)
- **Front-end UI/UX**: [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) (Component Framework)
- **Wallet-Link**: [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) (React Hooks for Ethereum)
- **On-Chain interaction**: [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/)
- **Smart Contract**: [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.23/), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started/) (SDK), [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/) (Upgradable Smart Contract Components)
- **Testing**: [Waffel](https://getwaffle.io/) ([Smart Contract Testing](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/other-guides/waffle-testing)), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) (JavaScript Test Framework), [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) (BDD/TDD Assertion Library)
- **Back-end**: Python, [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) (only for nofraud.token database)
- **AI-Assistance**: [GPT-4](https://openai.com/gpt-4/), [DALL·E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3)
- **CDN/CAPTCHA**: [Cloudflare Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/), [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/)

## 0x03 Challenges we may run into
- **Knowledge and Skills**: Imbalance in basic knowledge and development skills among our team members
- **Project management**: What project management tools and methods are best suited for a project of this size and a team of six?
- **Time management**: All of our team members have their own regular jobs or studies during the weekdays, and they can spare an hour a day during the week at most for self-study and project development, and on two days of the weekend we work together on Live Coding development within the framework of the regular weekly activities of KITKryptoDAO
- **Selection of technology stack and development tools**: Hardhat or Foundary? Vue or React? Wagmi adapter for Vue-based front-end?
- **Chainlink functions**: How to make meaningful use of the functions, features, and SDKs provided by Chainlink in our projects?
- **Upgradeable contract**: Our smart contracts need to be upgradeable at the very beginning, in order to handle the changing functionality requirements and to address new types of fraud NFTs that may appear in the future
